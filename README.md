# Video Processing - Movement Detection and Counting
A python script that can detect cars moving in the video and count the number of moving objects. This is the prototype of my final coursework project, I used the basis of the detection system shown in this python script and created a full-fledged [Camer Surveillance System](https://github.com/RoninSanta/CM3070-Camera-Surveillance-System-Project).
